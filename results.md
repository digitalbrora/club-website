<h1>This is the results page</h1>

<p>This will include a list of all the completed fixtures</p>

<p>At this stage I hope it will come from information in a Google spreadsheet, allowing others to update when necessary</p>

<p>Match reports will be added in the 'News' section and linked to each fixture</p>
