Brora Rangers extended their run of P&J Highland League wins to 10 as they opened their 2017/18 campaign with a 2-0 win away to Lossiemouth.



A workmanlike if laboured performance saw the pre season favourites return from the seaside with all 3 points, after a Sid Mackay first half header and an in off own goal following a drive from Martin Maclean.



Lossiemouth set out to defend and played a 5-4-1 formation which made life difficult for the Cattachs, and Lossiemouth were restricted to just a solitary strike at goal in either half. Joe Malin in the Brora goal will not have an easier shift all season as Ross, Duff, Williamson and Mackay easily defended a Brora back line which was rarely troubled.



From the off, Brora had the home side on the back foot and Campbell x3, Greig x2 and Macleod peppered the home goal. Within the first 25 minutes Brora had forced 12 corners, and Duff, Nicolson and Williamson send headers narrowly wide with the Lossiemouth keeper well beaten.



Brora's backline were always the most likely to score and indeed it proved that way as Steven Mackay put the visitors ahead, latching onto a ball at the back post to head past Cameron Farquhar.



The resilient home defence held out with just the one goal deficit as referee Billy Baxter blew for half time.



The second half was a mirror image of the first with Brora totally dominant and keeper Joe Malin was often seen rambling around the Brora half of the pitch as the action was concentrated in the Lossiemouth half of the pitch.



Again Brora looked most dangerous from corners and set pieces and Duff, Williamson and Nicolson were so unlucky not to add to the tally. Kyle Macleod also saw his header cannon off the bar.



Lossiemouth rarely crossed the half way line and whilst they played some nice possession passes, it accounted for little, and posed no threat to the visitors.



Deservedly Brora increased their lead after 74 minutes when a bagatelle ball was picked up by Martin Maclean in the box and drove it goalward which was deflected into his  own net by Aaron Hamilton.



Graham, Brindle and latterly Gunn took their turn in the fray but no further progress was made and Brora settled for 2 goals, a clean sheet and most importantly 3 points.



Brora Manager Ross Tokley was delighted with the 3 points but frustrated with the home sides tactics. "Lossiemouth set out on a damage limitation exercise and to that end they will be pleased. We've travelled away to a ground we lost 4-1 at last season, so we have righted a wrong. We could have had half a dozen or more but sometimes it just doesn't go your way. 3 points is what matters and we've brought home the bacon"



Captain Jamie Duff was sanguine about the scoreline " they set out to defend and they did it well. We were frustrated but fundamentals were good and on another day things would be very different. We know we will be facing these tactics from other sides this season and we will have to work hard on our counter tactics"  



With 8 games to be played by the end of August, Tokely will be keeping his selection options open.
