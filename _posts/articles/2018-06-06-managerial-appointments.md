Brora Rangers are delighted to announce the appointments of both Steven Mackay and Craig Campbell to their management team and they will take up their positions with immediate effect.

Steven Mackay will take up his role as 1st team manager and Craig will support him in a coaching capacity. It is also the Club’s intention to appoint an assistant to work with Steven and no doubt he will be giving the matter his careful consideration.

*Brora Rangers Chairman, William Powrie, has no doubts that this is an exciting appointment for The Cattachs:*

"We are absolutely delighted that Steven has accepted the offer to manage the team and are very comfortable that Steven is an ideal fit for the role. His vision and plans impressed greatly during his interview. He has been a stalwart of the team in recent years and certainly knows the club, the players and as importantly the fans. He has tasted much success at the club and the Board are very sure that he can again replicate this as a manager."

"His commercial and managerial experience outwith football will more than compensate for his perceived inexperience in the dugout and the club feel he will bring a variety of skill sets to the role."

"In Craig Campbell we have a player who again knows the club and has a Scottish League title winners medal in his kit bag with Alloa Athletic. He is respected within the changing room and will be perfect support for Steven as the playing cohort is reshaped."

"Ross Tokely delivered to the club much success and we have in Steven and Craig the ideal personnel to take this forward and challenge for league honours next season. We enjoyed an extended run in the Scottish Cup this year, but we were well off the pace on league duties, and I know we are a far better team than that."

*Steven Mackay had this to say on his new role:*

"I am incredibly excited and honoured to be appointed manager of Brora Rangers FC. I want to thank the Chairman and the board for having the belief and confidence to select an inexperienced manager. I am sure there were more experienced candidates available therefore I feel very privileged to be in this position. Although I am not officially retiring from playing, I do understand the challenges that I face by combining playing and managing and will take a balanced view on both during the coming weeks and months and will always base my decisions on what is best for Brora Rangers."

"There is a lot of work to be done in preparation for next season, reviewing the current playing squad and player recruitment will be my main priority initially, while also planning a pre-season schedule to ensure that we start next season as strong and prepared as possible."

"I will be looking to appoint an assistant manager but will take a little time to review my options. It is an important role and a demanding position so finding the correct person to suit that dynamic will be high on my priority list."

"I have appointed Craig Campbell as 1st Team Coach as I feel that he has the correct personality and skills to fulfil that role and believe that he will create a positive atmosphere with the players and the club as a whole."

"My ambition is very clear, I want to create an environment where players have the freedom to express themselves but always give 100% to the club. I have been fortunate enough to captain Brora Rangers during the most successful period in its history and I want the club to get back to that level of performance and achievement."

"The players and management team need to re-engage the relationship with the supporters. They are the life and soul of the football club and the players feed off their energy. I would love to see an increase in the number of supporters that attend both home and away games as they certainly add enhanced motivation for the players. I know the Chairman is planning to organise an open meeting for all the supporters once the full management team are in place and we will look forward to taking our place on that forum."

*Whilst Craig Campbell added:*

"I am thrilled and excited to accept the challenge to coach Brora Rangers. Having played with Steven at six different clubs, home and abroad, the opportunity to take the next step into coaching is one I’m eager to get started."

"Steven and I are different characters that bring out the best in each other and I am confident that as a team and with the support of the Chairman and board we can enjoy more success in the future."

"We finished the season with a real hard working and character building performance at Turriff on Saturday, so we go into the summer break with the wind behind us, and we will prepare thoroughly for the next campaign."
