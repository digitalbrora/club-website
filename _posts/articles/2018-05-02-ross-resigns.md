The Board of Brora Rangers are sorry to announce the resignation of Ross Tokely from the position of A Team Manager and he and his assistant Kevin Munro will be leaving the club with effect from today.



Club Chairman William Powrie commented “It is with great regret that Ross has decided to leave the Club, for whom he has been a great servant, both as a player and for the last 18 months as the team manager.



During his tenure at the helm Ross has won two North of Scotland FA Cups, and narrowly missed out on a Press & Journal Highland League title by just 1 point, having galvanised the team following his appointment in December 2016.



This season the club have enjoyed great success in the William Hill Scottish Cup, with Ross claiming the scalps of League 1 sides Stranraer and East Fife before being put out by Premiership club Kilmarnock in the 5th Round of the competition at Rugby Park. We attracted UK coverage of our exploits and fostered relationships with many new fans around the country.



However, our league campaign has been a big disappointment and I know Ross felt disappointed with this too, especially after a poor start to the season and letting other teams steal a march on the club. With the quality of the squad at Dudgeon Park he was clearly expecting a better campaign than we had.



We wish he and Kevin Munro all the very best for the future. They are dedicated professionals and have a wealth of football knowledge.



Club stalwart Alan Duff will be looking after the team on Saturday, where we travel to Turriff for our last league game of the season. The Board will be speaking to several people over the weekend and will be looking to move quickly to make new appointment.“
