  We say goodbye to some well-known faces around Dudgeon Park as Steven Mackay
  begins to formulate his plans for next season

We may have just entered the closed season but work behind the scenes does not stop and our new manager has been busy casting his eye over the squad and around and about, as he begins to formulate his playing plans for next season.

We say goodbye to some well-known faces around Dudgeon Park, and on behalf of the club I would wish them all the very best as they go forward both inside and outside of the game.

It is with great sadness and regret that Scott Houston will be retiring from the game due to a persistent knee injury. We can do no better than publish Scott’s note to us;

“My contract at the club runs out this summer and due to injury I’ve decided to take a step back from playing. A recent MRI scan indicated excessive wearing of my right knee’s hyaline cartilage, which if ignored will result in arthritis at a very young age. I’m only 30! The treatment for this is limited and only offers a very short term/temporary fix.

I’d just like to say a big thank you to all fans, players and coaches for making my time at Brora Rangers so enjoyable. I count myself lucky to have been signed up by Kirkie and Golly back in November 2013 and to have played a part in the success that followed.

The two league winning years were fantastic for the players and I know how much of a buzz it created around the village. There were great times on and off the pitch, with the team trip to Albufeira in the summer 2014 being a big highlight!! The team during season 2014/15 was unbelievable.

The defence took so much pride in clean sheets. There were big fall outs IF we conceded a goal. The attack and defence during that season was ruthless and of a standard much higher than the Highland League. Sometimes teams/players just click and it was obvious to see the belief and confidence the players and the fans had.

There’s a good core of the current squad who experienced all of that success and I know it won’t take much for things to click again and for the team to bring back that league title to Dudgeon Park.

I wish the club and fans the very best for the future and thank everyone for making my time with Brora so memorable.“

That statement speaks volumes about the player and tells us all we need to know about the man. Scott,you will be welcome back her anytime.

Club stalwart Alan Duff is to leave the club after numerous successful campaigns in the technical area, assisting David Kirkwood,Richard Brittain,Grant Munro and latterly Ross Tokely.


Alan felt that it was the right thing to do to step aside and allow the new management team to develop their own support function.

Alan was an absolute gentleman and a pleasure to be around. He was always a willing helper and the club are in a significantly better place on the back of Alan’s undoubted contributions.

We also bid farewell to the Lisle twins, Scott and Cameron. The lads have been popular figures around Dudgeon Park, and even today many of us still can’t tell the difference between the pair of them. Two absolutely smashing young lads will be joining Strathspey Thistle, with whom they both spent periods on loan. Both now need regular game time and at Brora this was not guaranteed.

Whilst the fee for the twins is undisclosed, Brora Rangers do have a sell on clause in the new contracts, such as the potential that we feel the boys have. We have every confidence that they will go from strength to strength with Strathspey and it would surprise us not a jot if at one day in the future they are back in the red shirts of the Cattach’s.


Away also will be club captain Jamie Duff. Jamie has been a rock at the heart of our defence this season and will be remembered for some absolutely outstanding performances especially at Stranraer and East Fife where he produced man of the match displays.

Jamie who is in the civil engineering business works away frequently and was unable to commit to a further term at Brora Rangers. If he decides to go to another club he will be an undoubted star acquisition, and we wish him well with his career.


We also bid au revoir to Scott Graham who out of contract, has joined Rothes FC. Scott produced some amazing performances throughout the season and was one of the best headers of the ball in the Highland League. Scott leads a nomadic existence around the grounds of the Highland League, and we wish him all the best as he pitches his tent in Mackessack Park for another campaign.

We look forward to the start of our new campaign with much optimism, which will again see the league remaining with 18 teams now that Fort William have regrouped and Cove Rangers who failed to overcome Cowdenbeath at the weekend in the pyramid playoff, still with us.
